# P2-FoodForce


Outline: Our proposal has two user interfaces, one for customers and another for employees. The customer facing side would allow people to place orders remotely, and be alerted when their orders are ready. The employee side would enable workers to receive and prepare orders before alerting customers that their order is ready to be picked up.
